# Example 5: Generated Release Metadata
#
# Scenario: This shows the release-metadata.yaml file generated
# automatically during release branch preparation. Based on a
# public-release scenario, this demonstrates how the release plan
# is transformed into release metadata with:
#
# - Generated fields added directly to the repository section
# - API versions with calculated pre-release extensions
# - Dependencies with resolved semantic versions
# - NO top-level generated_metadata or contacts sections
#
# This file would be created on a release branch (e.g., release/r4.4)
# and committed before tagging.
