# Example 2: Multi-API Repository with mixed API Status
#
# Scenario: A QualityOnDemand-style repository with multiple APIs with
# different API status values. This represents a pre-release-alpha
# with a mix of alpha, rc, and previously released public APIs.
#
# This represents a typical mature repository during a release cycle.
