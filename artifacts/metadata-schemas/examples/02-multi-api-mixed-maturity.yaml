# Example 2: Multi-API Repository with Mixed Maturity
#
# Scenario: A QualityOnDemand-style repository with multiple APIs at
# different maturity levels. Some APIs are being released as stable
# (public), while one remains unchanged from the previous release.
#
# This represents a typical mature repository during a release cycle.
