**Please be aware that the project will have frequent updates to the main branch. There are no compatibility guarantees associated with code in any branch, including main, until it has been released. For example, changes may be reverted before a release is published. For the best results, use the latest published release.**

The below sections record the changes for each API version in each release as follows:

* for an alpha release, the delta with respect to the previous release
* for the first release-candidate, all changes since the last public release
* for subsequent release-candidate(s), only the delta to the previous release-candidate
* for a public release, the consolidated changes since the previous public release

<!--Repeat the below release section (header 1 and subsections) at the top of this file for each new (pre-)release-->
