# Terminology

Quick reference for CAMARA release terminology.

## Release Numbering

**Repository release (`rX.Y`):** A tagged release of an entire API repository. Example: `r4.1`

**API version (`X.Y.Z`):** Semantic version of a single API. Example: `3.2.0-rc.2`

These are independent numbering systems.

## Release Configuration

**Release track:** How the repository participates in releases — `none`, `independent`, or `meta-release`.

**Meta-release:** A coordinated CAMARA release cycle (e.g., `Fall26`).

**Release type:** The maturity level of a repository release:

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `pre-release-alpha` | Early feedback |
| `pre-release-rc` | Release candidate |
| `public-release` | Production-ready |
| `maintenance-release` | Patch to existing release |

**API status:** The development level of an individual API: `draft` → `alpha` → `rc` → `public`

## Release Artifacts

**Release Issue:** Workflow-managed GitHub issue used to trigger and track a release.

**Release PR:** Pull request for reviewing release documentation.

**Draft release:** Prepared but unpublished GitHub release.

**Release tag:** Git tag marking a published release (e.g., `r4.1`).

## Release States

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| PLANNED | Release intent declared in release-plan.yaml |
| SNAPSHOT ACTIVE | Release PR under review |
| DRAFT READY | Draft awaiting publication |
| PUBLISHED | Release complete |
| NOT PLANNED | Release no longer planned |

## Metadata Files

**`release-plan.yaml`:** Declares release intent. Edited by codeowners on `main`.

**`release-metadata.yaml`:** Records actual release. Generated by automation.
