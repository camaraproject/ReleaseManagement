This is the documentation of the **CAMARA API Release process** and supporting templates.
More informaton about the full CAMARA Release Management process is available on the [CAMARA Wiki](https://lf-camaraproject.atlassian.net/wiki/x/VA7e).

The following gives a brief overview of the content of this documentation.

NOTE: deprecated documents will be moved to the Archive folder at the next Release Management repository release. When moved, they will be renamed by adding the extension "-deprecated-rx.y" in the filename.
