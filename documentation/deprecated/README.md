# Deprecated Documents

This folder contains superseded documents that are preserved for reference and link stability.

These documents were part of the original CAMARA release process documentation. They have been replaced by the new metadata-driven approach.

## Deprecated Documents

| Document | Replaced By | Deprecation Date |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| [API-Readiness-Checklist.md](API-Readiness-Checklist.md) | [readiness/api-readiness-checklist.md](../readiness/api-readiness-checklist.md) | 2026-01 |
| [API_Release_Guidelines.md](API_Release_Guidelines.md) | [release-process/](../release-process/) documentation | 2026-01 |
| [CHANGELOG_TEMPLATE.md](CHANGELOG_TEMPLATE.md) | Automated CHANGELOG generation | 2026-01 |

## Why These Documents Are Preserved

- Many external documents, issues, and wikis link to these files
- Preserving them prevents broken links during the transition period
- They serve as historical reference for the previous release process

## What to Use Instead

For current release process documentation, start with [../README.md](../README.md).
