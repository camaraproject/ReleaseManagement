To fill the checklist:
- in the line above the table, replace the api-name, api-version and the rx.y by their actual values for the current API version and release.
- in the Status column, put "Y" (yes) if the release asset is available or fulfilled in the current release, or "N" (no) otherwise. You can add comments as needed. Example: an intermediate alpha release or release candidate may not yet provide all mandatory release assets for the release type.
- in the Comments column, provide links to assets once available, and any other relevant comments.

Note: It is normal that the checklists of the (final) release candidate and its subsequent public release are the same, while additional release assets are required for a subsequent stable public release.
